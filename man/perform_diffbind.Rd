\usage{
perform_diffbind(
  sample_sheet_path,
  control_level,
  min_members = NULL,
  analysis_method = DBA_DESEQ2,
  fdr_threshold = 0.05,
  normalization = DBA_NORM_LIB
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample_sheet_path}{Character. The path to the sample CSV file.
Normally the file is named 'diffbind_samples.csv' and placed in the current
working directory. It must contain the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \strong{"SampleID"}
\item \strong{"Condition"}
\item \strong{"bamReads"}
\item \strong{"Peaks"}
\item \strong{"PeakCaller"}
}}

\item{control_level}{Name of reference group (e.g., "HET", "Ctrl").}

\item{min_members}{Minimum number of replicates per condition.
Set to 2 if any condition has only 2 replicates, otherwise set to \code{NULL}.}

\item{analysis_method}{The analysis method, either \code{DBA_DESEQ2} or \code{DBA_EDGER}.}

\item{fdr_threshold}{FDR cutoff for significance, used in both filtering
and visualization.}

\item{normalization}{Normalization method. One of \code{DBA_NORM_LIB}, \code{DBA_NORM_RLE},
\code{DBA_NORM_TMM}, etc. See DiffBind documentation}

\value{
analyzed diffbind object

\description{
perform_diffbind(sample_sheet_path, control_level, min_members, analysis_method,
data_type, fdr_threshold, normalization) performs a complete DiffBind analysis
workflow using a provided sample sheet, which includes blacklist filtering, counting,
normalization, and contrast setup.
